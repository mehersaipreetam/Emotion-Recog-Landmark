### Emotion Detector (Landmarking)

This project uses Landmarking (68) on face using .dat file present.

p1.py is a sample file to see landmarking in action. Refer to landmarks.jpg to see where these landmarks are.

1. Run face_mood_data.py to input an expression and data related. This will create a face_mood.npy file for you,

2. Now run face_mood_detect.py to see KNN classifier in action.
